AdaEmbeddedIRCClient is a project that mixes the 3 best things ever :
- Ada
- ESP8266
- IRC

It consists of a small IRC client running on the STM32F429 Discovery board.
This board is really nice, with a fantastic touch display, plenty of RAM
and ROM, but sadly with no Wi-Fi controller.

So, to get access to the Internet, we decided to use a small
microcontroller, called ESP8266.
The ESP-01 is a board that embeds a microcontroller.
The ESP-01 can be found for 1.70 dollars, and it's shipped with a
firmware that lets you control it by sending AT commands via UART.

More information about this AT command can be found here :

We first made a little driver to simplify the communication between the
ESP8266 and the STM32F429 Discovery.
We added several Ada contracts to check that the buffers for incoming
and for outgoing data do not overflow.

Then, we created some functions to connect to an IRC server, connect
with a nickname, an username, and a password, and finally parse
incomming IRC frames.
