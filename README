AdaEmbedddedIRCClient is a project consisting about mixing the 3 best things ever :
Ada
Esp8266
IRC

It's a small IRC client running on the STM32F429 Discovery. This board is really nice
with a fantastic touch display plenty of ram and rom but sadly no wifi on board.

So to get access to internet we decided to use a small microcontroler called ESP8266.
You can find the ESP-01 for 1.70 dollars, it's shipped with a firmware that let you
control it by sending AT commands via UART.

More information about this AT command set here => https://nurdspace.nl/ESP8266#AT_Commands

We first made a little driver to simplify the communication between the ESP8266 and 
the STM32F429 Discovery. We had some contract to check that does not overflow the Incomming
and Outgoing buffer.

Then, we created some functions to connect to an IRC server, connect with a Nickname,
Username, Password and finaly parse incomming IRC frame.
